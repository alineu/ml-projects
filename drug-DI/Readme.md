# Initial Goal
- Build a natural language processing model to recommend the right medicine according to the user condition

# Future Goal
* Use other resources such as **[Drug Bank](https://www.drugbank.ca/)** to make the model more robust by considering potential ***drug interactions, side effects*** etc. 
* Use other APIs such as **[GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/)** to build a **real-time model** that considers other user-defined factors such as ***location, price range, and ease of transportation, weather condition, delivery options*** etc. to make a more calculated decision
* Expand the usefulness of the app to ***medical professionals*** so that they can offer ***patients-customized solutions***
